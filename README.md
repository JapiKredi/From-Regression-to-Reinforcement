## Features
- **Supervised Learning**
  - Regression Algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Random Forests)
  - Classification Algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN)
- **Unsupervised Learning** *(coming soon!)*
  - Clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN)
  - Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA)
- **Reinforcement Learning** *(planned!)*
  - Value-Based Methods (e.g., Q-Learning)
  - Policy-Based Methods (e.g., DDPG)
